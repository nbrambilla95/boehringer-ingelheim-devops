# Boehringer Ingelheim - DevOps Repository

## About Me

Hello, my name is Nicolas! I am currently working as a DevOps engineer at Boehringer Ingelheim in the IT department. I work with various automation languages like Ansible, along with Python for scripting and automation tasks.

## Current Work

In my current role, I deal with a variety of tools on a daily basis to streamline and automate the operations in our department. Some of the tools I frequently use include:

- **AWX**: An open-source community project that provides a powerful interface for managing and controlling Ansible deployments.
- **Atlassian Bundle**: Including Bitbucket for version control, Confluence for team collaboration, and Jira for project management.
- **Jenkins**: A highly customizable continuous integration/continuous deployment tool.
- **Fortify**: A suite of comprehensive tools for application security testing and vulnerability management.
- **Webhook Relay**: A tool that helps in forwarding, transforming, and pushing webhooks to local and publicly accessible destinations.
